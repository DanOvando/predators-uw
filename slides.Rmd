# A Quantiative Fisheries Ecologist


> I use methods and ideas from ecology and economics to help understand and manage social-ecological systems. 


I study...
  - Fisheries assessment and management
  - Social-ecological impacts of policies
  - Predictive modeling
  
Using...
  - Bayesian methods
  - Econometrics
  - Simulation modeling

Based on...
  - Open and reproducible science
  - Collaboration

# Top Marine Predator Research

.pull-left[

- Fisheries management has had many successes

- Target and incidental catch threatens many top marine predators

- Damages oceans and people

- Solutions must address
  - Challenges of marine ecosystems
  - Human incentives

# Bigeye & Skipjack Tuna in the <br> Western & Central Pacific Ocean

.pull-left[

**At the time we started this** Bigeye tuna (*Thunnus obesus*)
  
  * $F/F_{MSY}$ = 1.5
  * $B/B_{MSY}$ = 1, but presumably headed down
  
Large part of mortality caused by **incidental capture** of juvenile bigeye in purse-seine targeting skipjack tuna (*Katsuwonus pelamis*)

Problem was known for a long time
  - Why wasn't it solved?

## Is Overfishing Rational? 

* Bigeye catches needed to be reduced by ~33% to get to $F/F_{MSY}$ of 1
    * Requires 81% decrease in purse seine BET if reductions from PS alone

* Assuming a 6% bigeye rate for purse-seine...
    * Would require a **62%** reduction in targeted skipjack catch
    * At a cost of **$1.7 billion**: more than twice value of targeted bigeye

* Value of skipjack losses > entire value of targeted bigeye fishery

* Does this explain persistent overfishing?

# A Coasean Bargain

* Coase suggests an alternative solution
    * Markets allow costs and benefits to align
    * "Beneficiary pays" rather than "polluter pays"

# A Bargain for Tuna
.pull-left[

- Coasean analysis helps identify *imbalances in costs and benefits*

- Particularly for highly migratory species, can point out **bottlenecks**

- Direct fishery benefits to bigeye do not outweigh costs to skipjack

- But, provides floor for *willingness to pay*

- Changing $L_{\infty}$ not a solution we'd considered...

# Managing Mobile Species in a Dynamic Ocean

???

- Many marine top predators
  
  - Move large distances 
  
  - Have dynamic habitats
  
- Intersect with growing and changing demands from people

- Climate change shifting distributions

# MPAs & Marine Predators

> “Effective protected and conserved areas to cover at least 30% of the planet by 2030” (IUCN)

>“The Biden-Harris Administration’s policy, as written in Executive Order 14008, calls for the U.S. to conserve at least 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030”


- Growing call for MPAs to manage marine populations

# MPAs and Marine Predators

.pull-left[

One strategy:
**Design MPAs that move with species**

  - Better bycatch outcomes
  
  - Lower fishery costs

The challenge... 
  - Incorporating dynamics of fish and fleets
  - Dynamic planning given imperfect information
  - Causal inference of spatial policies

# Teaching & Mentorship

Teaching is a core reason I want to be part of the UW

  - Revitalizing "Super advanced R"
  
  - Seeking out opportunity to teach FSH 323
  
I believe in **active** and **applied** learning
  
  - Fundamentals of open and reproducible science
  
  - Experience with real-world problem solving
  
  - Preparing students for careers in and out of Academia

<br>

# A Coasean Bargain

* Is regulation the only solution?
    
    * Resistance will be strong
    * Enforcement costs high

* Coase suggests an alternative solution
    * Markets allow costs and benefits to align
    * "Beneficiary pays" rather than "polluter pays"

* Can benefits of bigeye conservation outweigh costs?

  - Purse seine BET rate is low in aggregate
  - Hot-spots in space and time

# MPAs and Marine Predators

.pull-left[

Critical dynamics to consider

- Marine species move

- Heterogeneous and dynamic habitat

- Fishing fleets respond

**How do these dynamics affect performance of static and dynamic MPAs**?
